- This is an expense tracker that helps you track your expenses efficiently and effectively. Built with a modern tech stack, it provides a seamless experience for users to manage their finances. This project leverages TypeScript, Next.js for the frontend and backend, Prisma as the ORM, Neon for the database, and Clerk for user authentication.

**Tech Stack**

- TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- Next.js: A React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications.
- Prisma: A modern database toolkit that makes it easy to access your database with an auto-generated and type-safe query builder for TypeScript.
- Neon: A scalable serverless Postgres with a focus on developer experience.
- Clerk: An authentication solution that provides a suite of tools for managing user accounts.

**Features**

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration using Clerk.
- Expense Management: Add, edit, and delete expenses.
- Categorization: Categorize expenses for better organization.
- Real-time Updates: Expenses are updated in real-time with a responsive UI.
- Data Persistence: All data is securely stored in a Neon database.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
